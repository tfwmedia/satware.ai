A modern, responsive documentation website for satware.ai, built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the beautiful [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. This repository serves as the source for the static website deployed to GitHub Pages.

## ✨ Features

*   **Clean & Responsive Design**: Powered by Material for MkDocs, ensuring a great experience on any device.
*   **Easy Documentation**: Write content in Markdown, and MkDocs handles the rest.
*   **Local Development with Docker**: Simple setup for local development with live-reloading.
*   **Automated Deployment**: Seamless deployment to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Local Development

Developing locally is streamlined using Docker, which encapsulates all necessary dependencies.

**Prerequisites:**

*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed and running on your system.

**Steps:**

1.  **Fork the original repository**: Fork the `satwareAG/satware.ai` repository to your GitHub account.
2.  **Clone your fork**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/satware.ai.git
    cd satware.ai
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.)

3.  **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    ./mkdocs.sh
    ```
    This command will build the Docker image (if not already built) and start a local development server. The website will be accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Any changes you make to the documentation files (`docs/`) will automatically trigger a live reload in your browser.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **Static Site Generator**: MkDocs
*   **Theme**: Material for MkDocs (v9.6.14)
*   **Containerization**: Docker
*   **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
*   **Styling**: SCSS (Sass) with `pysassc`
*   **Language**: Python (v3.13-slim-bullseye in Docker)
*   **SCSS Watcher**: Custom Python script (`scss_watcher.py`)

## 🌐 Deployment

The `satware.ai` website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.

**Workflow for your fork (for testing/preview):**

1.  **Push to your fork**: When you push changes to your fork (`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/satware.ai`), specifically to the `main-mkdocs` branch.
2.  **GitHub Pages Setup**: Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled for your fork, building from the `gh-pages` branch.
3.  **GitHub Actions Trigger**: A GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) is triggered.
4.  **Build & Deploy**: This workflow builds the static website using MkDocs and deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch of your fork.
5.  **Live Website**: The static website becomes available at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/satware.ai/`.

**Workflow for the main repository (live site):**

*   Changes merged into the `main-mkdocs` branch of the *original* `satwareAG/satware.ai` repository will trigger the live site deployment to `https://satware.ai/`.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

*   **SCSS Changes Not Reflecting**: Ensure the `scss_watcher.py` is running correctly within your Docker container. Check the Docker logs for any errors during SCSS compilation. The `scss_watcher.py` monitors `overrides/assets/css/custom.scss` and compiles it to `docs/assets/css/custom.css`.
*   **Docker Issues**: If you encounter issues with the `./mkdocs.sh` script, verify that Docker is running and that you have the necessary permissions.
